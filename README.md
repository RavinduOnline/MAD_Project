Infinity Store

Due to this pandemic situation in the country, many people are unable to go out to buy their daily necessities. Others are reluctant and afraid to go out because of the plague. As a result, the number of customers visiting our company on an average day has decreased by about 50%. As a solution to this, we focused on creating an app that sells products online. Through this App, we look forward to serving all the people of Sri Lanka.  
“Infinity” app allows customers to easily discover products they are looking to buy. Through this app, the customer can order the required items. It can be paid in cash as well as by card. The order will be delivered to customer doorstep through our delivery service. This app provides services for COVID-19 patients through debit cards in a contactless manner as well as card payment, Cash on Delivery to the public. 
This application aims to provide relevant services even during the travel restrictions period. For these reasons, we hope that a growing number of consumers will gather around this application. In the future, we aim to further enhance this app with new features such as website and Delivery services tracking, and PayHear's payment gateway integration. Adding products and services to the database of this application is done by the administrator through our admin portal website.
  
There are four main functionalities we identified in this system
•	Manage customer account and Wishlist
•	Manage Product and Cart
•	Manage Payment and shipping
